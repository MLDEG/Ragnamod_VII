# Familiar Rings 

Familiar rings can be added to loot tables like regular items. They need the nbt `{familiarType: "<TYPE>"}` to automatically create the associated familiar with stats & random name.

This can be tested by spawning such a ring with: `/give @p occultism:familiar_ring{familiarType:"occultism:greedy_familiar"}`
